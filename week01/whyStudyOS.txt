 The backbone of network infrastructure, the base of internet is a hardware piece, which we technically call as a Server. Server is in some ways similar to CPU in terms of functionality.

A high performance CPU with high technical and hardware specs can be called as a Server. So what does a CPU run to do tasks or to implement instructions?

It runs a Operating System. The whole world today depends on internet. Everything which you see and follow directly or indirectly depends on Internet. Now, Server is a backbone of the Internet Community. Every instruction is implemented by a Server which runs some sort of Operating System.

To make this world better or to influence the world of Internet, you should definitely know about a Operating System. It's the base of everything. There are basically 2 types of operating systems that are mainly used on Servers, a flavour of Linux and Windows Server OS.

So learning about OSs will definitely help you in some ways to contribute to this world.
